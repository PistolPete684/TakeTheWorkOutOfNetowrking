By Karen Wickre

14 valuable lessons from Taking the Work Out of Networking: Your Guide to Making and Keeping Great Connections:

1. Networking is not about selling yourself, it's about building relationships. The goal of networking is to make genuine connections with people who can help you and who you can help in return.
   
2. Focus on quality over quantity. It's better to have a few close relationships with people who are truly valuable to you than to have a large number of superficial connections.
   
3. Be authentic and genuine. People can spot a fake a mile away, so be yourself and let your personality shine through.
   
4. Be a good listener. People appreciate being heard, so take the time to listen to what others have to say.
   
5. Ask thoughtful questions. This shows that you're interested in what the other person has to say and that you're not just there to promote yourself.
    
6. Follow up after you meet someone. Send a quick email or note to thank them for their time and to stay in touch.
    
7. Nurture your relationships over time. Networking is an ongoing process, so make an effort to stay in touch with your connections on a regular basis.
    
8. Don't be afraid to ask for help. People are often happy to help others if they can.
    
9. Be willing to help others. When you help others, you're not only doing a good deed, you're also building goodwill and making yourself more memorable.
    
10. Use social media to your advantage. Social media is a great way to connect with people and stay up-to-date on their latest news.
    
11. Join relevant professional organizations. This is a great way to meet people in your field and to learn about new opportunities.
    
12. Attend industry events. This is a great way to network with people in your field and to learn about new trends.
    
13. Be patient. Networking takes time and effort, so don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately.
    
14. Just keep putting yourself out there and making connections. The more you network, the better you'll get at it and the more valuable connections you'll make.
    
By following these tips, you can take the work out of networking and build a powerful network of connections that can help you achieve your career goals.
